# The code you provided is a Bézier curve. Bézier curves are a type of parametric curve that are commonly used in computer graphics to represent smooth curves. The code you provided defines a Bézier curve with 10 control points. The control points are listed in the order in which they are used to define the curve. The first and last control points are the endpoints of the curve, and the other control points are used to control the shape of the curve.

# The code you provided also defines the color of the curve. The color is specified as a hexadecimal value, which is a 6-digit number that represents the red, green, and blue components of the color. In this case, the color is #ff0000, which is red.

# To draw the Bézier curve, you can use the following code:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

def draw_bezier_curve(control_points, color):
    points = np.array([control_points[0]] + control_points + [control_points[0]])
    plt.plot(points[:, 0], points[:, 1], color=color)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    control_points = np.array([
        [106.64, 140.37],
        [103.61, 142.29],
        [100.15, 143.55],
        [96.83, 144.85],
        [89.88, 147.59],
        [82.74, 149.82],
        [75.38, 151.09],
        [67.94, 152.37],
        [60.31, 152.85],
        [52.81, 151.85],
    ])
    color = "#ff0000"
    draw_bezier_curve(control_points, color)
    plt.show()


# This code will draw the Bézier curve in the red color. You can change the color of the curve by changing the value of the `color` variable.
